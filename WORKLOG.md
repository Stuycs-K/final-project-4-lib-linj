## Brian Li

### 05/19/2023

- Developed a basic program for a Matrix object to be used for the Hill Cipher.
  - Includes an identity method, matrix multiplication method, and necessary matrix manipulation methods as a prerequisite for the Hill Cipher.

### 05/22/2023

- Added cofactor, GCD methods to the Matrix object for future decodes.
- Found additional resources for conducting a [Known Plaintext Attack - WCSU](https://sites.wcsu.edu/mbxml/html/sample_hill_analysis_kpt.html).
